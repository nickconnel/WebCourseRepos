  <textarea rows="6" cols="120">The restaurant has been continuously in operation since the early 1800's.  Some of the first settlers in the region were its first patrons.  It is rumored that president Abraham Lincoln himself visited the facility 2 years before he became president.  The inside has of course seen many makovers in the latst century.  We of course Have running water an electricity.  Oh, and central heat.  All or our ingredients are souced locally, and sustainably harvested.  This place has been run by the same group of fine people for at least the last 50 years.  Not many people know this, but there is a band that plays of fridays.  They are good, you should check them out!</textarea>
